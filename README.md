To run this:
1. Edit variables in the get_sync_sources.sh.
2. Edit the lunch and make commands in build.sh
    * Also you can add some exports command here like export SELINUX_IGNORE_NEVERALLOWS=true etc.
3. Run ```bash START.SH```

#### Note:
* You can run each shell file respectively by doing ```bash <filename>.sh``` if ever you want to just sync or just build.
